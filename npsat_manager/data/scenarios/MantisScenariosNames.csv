Well Type Scenario,VI,Public Supply Wells and Irrigation Wells,Computes nitrate-N at large production wells,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at all large production wells - irrigation wells and public supply wells.  These wells are explicitly represented in the underlying flow model as pumping wells. Their specific location is precise to the township-section (1 square mile) and randomized within the section. The well pumping rate, screen length and depth corresponds to reported values, where available, or to a simulated, randomized values that are typical for wells in the corresponding groundwater sub-basin.,
Well Type Scenario,VD,Domestic Wells,Computes nitrate-N at domestic wells,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at all domestic wells known to California DWR. These wells are assumed to have very low pumping rates. Their specific location is precise to the township-section (1 square mile) and randomized within the section. The well screen length and depth corresponds to reported values, where available, or to a simulated, randomized values that are typical for wells in the corresponding groundwater sub-basin.,
Well Type Scenario,VM,Virtual Shallow Monitoring Well Network Grid,Computes nitrate-N in a virtual monitoring well network,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at hypothetical monitoring wells in the shallow part of the aquifer. Monitoring wells are placed every 165 ft and "measure" the average nitrate-N concentration across the first 200 ft below the water table.,
