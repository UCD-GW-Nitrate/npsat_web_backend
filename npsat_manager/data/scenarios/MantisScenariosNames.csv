Unsaturated Scenario,C2VSIM_SPRING_2000,Typical vadose zone thickness (spring 2000),Based on 2000 spring data from the C2Vsim fine grid model ,,gwt.ucdavis.edu
Unsaturated Scenario,C2VSIM_SPRING_2015,Drought vadose zone thickness (spring 2015),Based on 2015 spring data from the C2Vsim fine grid model,,gwt.ucdavis.edu
Flow Scenario,C2VSIM_III_03,C2Vsim,"This scenario is based on a long-term average of C2VSim flow conditions. Flow conditions are averaged over separate, balanced periods for each of the three large regions, Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, and Tulare Lake Basin. (A CVHM based flow scenario is awaiting release of CVHM 2).",,gwt.ucdavis.edu
Flow Scenario,CVHMRun01,CVHM(currently unavailable),Simulation based on CVHM average flow conditions. Each basin has been averaged on a different period,,gwt.ucdavis.edu
Well Type Scenario,VI,Public Supply Wells and Irrigation Wells,Computes nitrate-N at large production wells,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at all large production wells - irrigation wells and public supply wells.  These wells are explicitly represented in the underlying flow model as pumping wells. Their specific location is precise to the township-section (1 square mile) and randomized within the section. The well pumping rate, screen length and depth corresponds to reported values, where available, or to a simulated, randomized values that are typical for wells in the corresponding groundwater sub-basin.,
Well Type Scenario,VD,Domestic Wells,Computes nitrate-N at domestic wells,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at all domestic wells known to California DWR. These wells are assumed to have very low pumping rates. Their specific location is precise to the township-section (1 square mile) and randomized within the section. The well screen length and depth corresponds to reported values, where available, or to a simulated, randomized values that are typical for wells in the corresponding groundwater sub-basin.,
Well Type Scenario,VM,Virtual Shallow Monitoring Well Network Grid(currently unavailable),Computes nitrate-N in a virtual monitoring well network,This scenario predicts the nitrate-N outcome at hypothetical monitoring wells in the shallow part of the aquifer. Monitoring wells are placed every 165 ft and "measure" the average nitrate-N concentration across the first 200 ft below the water table.,
